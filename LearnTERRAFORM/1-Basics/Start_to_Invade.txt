Start to invade
----------------
Note - I am creating directory terraform and keeping terraform files inside that and running all commands from inside terraform directory. (/home/admin/terraform)

1) Initialize terraform
Very first time we need to Initialize terraform, in this process it will check it's dependencies and will install it.
Command to Initialize terraform is...

terraform init 

2) Understand syntax
<BLOCK TYPE> "<BLOCK LABEL>" "<BLOCK LABEL>" {
  # Block body
  <IDENTIFIER> = <EXPRESSION> # Argument
}
 
resource "aws_instance" "test1" {
  ami           = "ami-083ebc5a49573896a"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

# Blocks are containers for other content and usually represent the configuration of some kind of object, 
like a resource. Blocks have a block type, can have zero or more labels, and have a body that contains any 
number of arguments and nested blocks. Most of Terraform's features are controlled by top-level blocks in a 
configuration file.
# Arguments assign a value to a name. They appear within blocks.
# Expressions represent a value, either literally or by referencing and combining other values. They appear as values for arguments, or within other expressions.

3) Create instance.tf to spin one ec2 instance
refer instance.tf

4) validate our configuration 
terraform validate

5) make conf file in good format
terraform fmt

6) check Plan
terraform plan

This command will go through all the files available in current path and will show us PLAN. 
In PLAN generally it shows what is going to be created, updated, and deleted.
i.e.
Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

7) apply terrform configuration
terraform apply

This command will again show PLAN and ask for approval to make change.

8) login in aws and check new instance created or not.

9) destroy whole infrastructure
terraform destroy

terraform.tfstate
-------------------
terraform.tfstate file play very important role in terraform. It is db for terraform, contain status of infrastructure at the time of last apply command.
If this file get deleted, then whatever infrastructure created till the time, will be stateless and can not control by terraform.


###############################
It is a always a good idea to take bluprint of terrform plan and then apply that blueprint.
terraform plan -out bluprint
terraform apply bluprint

Note - once bluprint created it can be used only once. After creating bluprint if there is any change in infrastructure,
it will not work. You will get below error.

Error: Saved plan is stale

The given plan file can no longer be applied because the state was changed by
another operation after the plan was created.
