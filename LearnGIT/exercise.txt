#Before doing anything lets understand how GIT works.
1) we create repo on github.com
2) we clone it on our system. this is called local repository.
So now we have 2 repository, one Remote repository (created on github.com), and another one is local repository (which is on our system.)
3) we create file in workspace. Workspace is different than local repository.
4) we add newly created file in index. Index is db, list of files tracked by git for any changes, which contains detail about changes in local repository.
Note - Only newly created file need to add in index.
5) we execute commit command, which submit changes done in workspace to local repository.
6) we execute push command which push changes from local repository to remote repository.

#Create git account on github.com

#Create git repo

#install git on server
yum install git -y

#clone git on server
git clone https://github.com/indorenilesh/myfirstrepo.git

#create test file inside repo and check status
cd myfirstrepo
vim test
	This is my first edit.
git status

#add new file in index
git add test.txt
git status

#comit file in local repo
git commit -m "first edit"
git status

#push changes to github
git push

#Open test.txt file in github make changes and save/commit it.
	This is my second edit.

#pull repo to get latest update.
git pull

#edit test file agin and 3rd line
cd myfirstrepo
vim test
	This is my third edit.
git status
git add test.txt
git status
git commit -m "third edit"
git status
git push

#Now I want a older version of file.
#check git log for older versions of file
git log --oneline

#select version id and restore it
git checkout <versionid> test.txt
git status
git add test.txt
git status
git commit -m "third edit"
git status
git push

######### how to upload your existing project on git  ############
#create directory and inside that directory
git init

#create some file then add and commit those files locally
git add *
git config --global user.email "indorenilesh@gmail.com"
git config --global user.name "Nilesh Indore"
git commit -m "msg"
 
#create git repo on github.com

#inform local git about remote git
git remote add origin https://github.com/indorenilesh/mysecondrepo.git

#push files to remote git
git push

############## difference between git fetch and git pull ############
1) create new file add one line in file.
2) push change to git
3) edit file add second line in remote repository
4) do git fetch - will fetch changes
5) check file in workspace - no changes
6) do git pull 
7) check file in workspace - you will get new changes.

Bottom line
------------
1) git fetch fetches update from remote repository to local repository
2) git pull pulls updates from remote repository to workspace directly.
3) before commiting workspace changes do git fetch to know that is there any changes done in orignal(remote) repository.
This will help not to loose workspace changes.
